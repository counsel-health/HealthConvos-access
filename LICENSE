3. I will not share access to HealthConvos restricted data with anyone else.
4. I will exercise all reasonable and prudent care to maintain the physical and electronic security of HealthConvos restricted data.
5. If I find information within HealthConvos restricted data that I believe might permit identification of any individual or institution, I will report the location of this information promptly by email to privacy@counselhealth.com, citing the location of the specific information in question so that it can be investigated and removed if necessary.
6. I have requested access to HealthConvos restricted data for the sole purpose of lawful use in scientific research, and I will use my privilege of access, if it is granted, for this purpose and no other.
7. I have completed a training program in human research subject protections and HIPAA regulations, and I am submitting proof of having done so.
8. I will indicate the general purpose for which I intend to use the database in my application.
9. If I openly disseminate my results, I will also contribute the code used to produce those results to a repository that is open to the research community.
10. This agreement may be terminated by either party at any time, but my obligations with respect to HealthConvos restricted data shall continue after termination.
